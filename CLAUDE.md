# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Running the Application

No build step required. Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser. There are no npm packages, build tools, or dependencies.

Configuration is loaded at runtime from published Google Sheets CSV URLs (see `js/config.js` → `SHEET_URLS`). A "↺ Reload Config" button on the title screen re-fetches it.

## Architecture

The game is split across `index.html` (markup + inline styles) and multiple JS files under `js/`:

| File | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `js/utils.js` | `rotC` (shape rotation), `sfl` (shuffle), `mkDeck`, `dealHand`, helpers |
| `js/treat-effects.js` | Add/mul helper functions (`surrAdd`, `rowAdd`, `colAdd`, `allAdd`, `allMulCS`, `colMul`, `surrMulCS`, `shapeMul`) |
| `js/treats/registry.js` | `TREAT_REGISTRY = {}` — named treats register here |
| `js/treats/requirements.js` | `REQUIREMENT_FNS` map + `requirementFails(req)` |
| `js/treats/<id>.js` | One file per treat with custom logic (see Treat System below) |
| `js/config.js` | Fetches Google Sheets CSVs, parses into globals (`CFG`, `RCFG`, `COLS`, `EMS`, `TDEFS`, `CSHAPES`, `DECKS`), calls `buildTreatFn` |
| `js/state.js` | Global mutable state `G` and `H` |
| `js/board.js` | Placement validation (`boardCanPlace`) and committing pieces |
| `js/backpack.js` | Inventory grid management |
| `js/held.js` | Mouse/touch drag-and-drop logic |
| `js/render.js` | All DOM updates (`renderAll`, `renderBoard`, `renderHand`, `renderBP`, `renderShopFull`) |
| `js/scoring.js` | `doFit()`, `runScoreSequence()`, `endScoreSequence()` — four phases: base → add treats → mul treats → board fill bonus |
| `js/shop.js` | Treat purchasing and reroll logic |

Script load order in `index.html` matters: utils → treat-effects → registry → requirements → treat files → config → state → board → backpack → held → render → scoring → shop.

## Key Data Structures

**`G` (game state):**
```
round, score, tgt, bsr/bsc (board dims), earn, hands, disc, cash,
deckId, deck[], hand[], board[][] (2D grid of cells), bp[][] (backpack),
bpGroups[], cats[], treats[]
```

**`H` (held piece):**
```
kind ('cat'|'treat'|'shop-treat'|null), source, data,
cells (2D shape), rot (0-3), color, em, handIdx/boardGid/bpGid,
grabDr/grabDc (grab offset within shape), dragging
```

**Board cell:** `{ filled, col, kind, em, gid, shape, type }`

**TDEF (treat definition):** `{ id, nm, em, rar, col, phase, bpS, ef, req, pr, sp, fl, fn }`

## Screen Flow

`s-loading` → `s-title` (deck select) → `s-rounds` (round info + shop) → `s-game` (gameplay) → `s-shop` (between rounds)

Screens are `display:none` by default and made visible with class `.on`.

## Gameplay Loop

`doFit()` triggers the score sequence → `runScoreSequence()` animates phases → `endScoreSequence()` checks win/loss → `roundWin()` or next hand dealt via `dealHand()`.

## Treat System

Every treat in the sheet has its own file at `js/treats/<id>.js`. Each file registers into `TREAT_REGISTRY`:

```js
TREAT_REGISTRY['id'] = {
  buildFn(ef, phase) {
    // return a function (b, cats, ts, p, cs) => { bonus, desc } or { gids, m }
  }
};
```

`buildTreatFn(id, ef, phase)` in `config.js` checks the registry first; falls back to generic pattern matching only for treats without a registry entry.

Add-phase functions return `{ bonus, desc }`. Mul-phase functions return `{ gids: [...], m: N }`.

### All treats (from Google Sheet)

| ID | Name | Phase | Effect | Requirement |
|----|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| milk | WARM MILK | add | +8 to ALL cats | — |
| catnip | CATNIP | add | +25 to cats in same ROW | — |
| feather | FEATHER | add | +25 to cats in same COL | — |
| box | BOX | add | +25 to SURROUNDING cats | — |
| sardine_tin | SARDINE TIN | add | (special) | — |
| yarn | YARN BALL | mul | ×2 L shaped cats | — |
| laser | LASER POINTER | x | copies ability of one other random treat | — |
| jumping_ball | JUMPING BALL | x | disable one random treat's requirement | — |
| brownies | BROWNIES | x | add duplicate of one random surrounding cat to deck | — |
| nap | POWER NAP | mul | ×2 ALL cats | NO OTHER TREAT |
| frenzy | FRENZY BALL | mul | ×3 SURROUNDING cats | ALL SAME TYPE |
| catnado | CATNADO | mul | ×2 ALL cats | ALL SAME TYPE |
| tuna_can | TUNA CAN | mul | ×2 all ORANGE cats | — |

## Configuration Data Source

Live data is fetched from published Google Sheets CSV endpoints defined in `SHEET_URLS` in `js/config.js`. Tabs: General, Rounds, Treats, Cats, Shapes, Decks.
